                In this episode of Salty Talk, the faithfulness of God is woven through stories of healing, provision, and obedience. From a supernatural moment of restored sight to unexpected answers to prayer, the testimony reminds us that God still moves in power and that He meets people right where they are—whether in a church pew, on the street, or in the quiet of their prayers.

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    One of the most powerful stories shared was about a man at Golf View UMC who had been struggling with blindness. After being prayed for, he opened his eyes and began to see—stunned, shaking, and overwhelmed. It was a moment described as nothing short of a Damascus encounter with Jesus. His life shifted instantly, not only because his sight was restored, but because he knew God had touched him personally.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    But the episode didn’t stop with a single miracle. It also highlighted the journey of healing—how some works of God happen instantly while others unfold slowly, step by step. The message was clear: God is the Healer, and He meets each person in the way they need Him most.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Another story revealed God's provision in ministry. A growing need to provide first-aid care for the homeless seemed impossible to meet—until a retired nurse, led by dreams and stirred by prayer, reached out and offered her time and compassion. What looked like coincidence was unmistakably God’s orchestration. And now, as the ministry awaits a February 18 grant decision for a heavy-duty pickup to tow the mobile shower trailer, the call to prayer continues. Every step forward is another opportunity to watch God provide.

                    Maybe you find yourself hoping for a miracle, or maybe you’re walking through a slow, painful process that feels endless. Take heart—Jesus is not done with you. He sees your wounds, your doubts, your exhaustion, and He draws near. Whether your breakthrough comes suddenly or gradually, His faithfulness remains the same. He is the God who heals, restores, and provides. Lean into Him. Ask boldly. Trust deeply. And don’t walk the journey alone.

                    Today, choose faith over fear. Ask God where He is calling you to serve outside your comfort zone. Pray for those in need, especially our homeless neighbors. And please join us in praying for the February 18 grant decision—believing with us that God will provide the truck needed to move the shower trailer and expand this ministry. Say yes to God’s leading, and watch Him move.
