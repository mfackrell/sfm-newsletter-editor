                Episode 30/31 of Salty Talk brought unforgettable God stories from the streets of Panama City Beach—stories of healing, compassion, and God’s relentless pursuit of the broken. From a man nearly blind encountering miraculous restoration, to a retired nurse answering a divine call to care for the unhoused, the Lord’s hand was unmistakably present in every moment.

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    During a feeding outreach, a man nearly blind—discouraged, hurting, and unsure of his worth—walked into the gathering. He could barely see the faces in front of him, but he came anyway, desperate for hope. Volunteers prayed over him with the simple belief that God still heals. Days later, he returned with a testimony that stunned everyone: his eyesight had begun to return. He described it as a “Damascus moment,” a sudden breaking-in of God’s mercy in the middle of his darkness.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The hosts reminded listeners that healing comes in different ways. Some receive it instantly. Others walk it out slowly. And for many, it unfolds over a long journey. Michelle emphasized that waiting does not mean God has forgotten—it means He is still moving. She urged believers not to give up when the miracle seems delayed.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Another powerful testimony came through a long-prayed-for need on the streets: basic medical care for the unhoused. For years, the ministry recognized the need for first aid, wound treatment, and health education. Then God brought a retired nurse who had been experiencing dreams and nudges from the Holy Spirit. She joined the outreach team and immediately began praying for people, cleaning wounds, and offering dignity-filled care. Her arrival affirmed that the Church must go outside its walls—because ministry begins where the broken are. She simply said “yes,” and God used it.

                    If you’re reading this with your own struggles—addiction, fear, shame, chronic pain, or a past that feels too heavy—hear this: God is near. He is not intimidated by your brokenness. He is not tired of your prayers. And you are not disqualified from His love or His miracles. The same God who restored sight on a street corner and sent a nurse through dreams sees you today. He’s pursuing you with compassion and purpose.

                    Take a moment to pray. Worship even if you don’t feel like it. Give thanks for one thing today. And if God is nudging you to serve—especially outside the church walls—say yes. Keep the ministry in prayer as they await the February 18 board decision for a grant to purchase a heavy-duty truck to tow the shower trailer, a vital tool for restoring dignity to the unhoused community.
