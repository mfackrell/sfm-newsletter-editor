                During the Global Impact Celebration at Shiloh Baptist Church in Chipley, Florida, the missions committee shared how God moved powerfully through their congregation. What began as a simple vetting of ministries turned into a full-hearted embrace of local missions—including Salty Farm Ministries—as the church stepped into hands-on compassion, education, and new partnerships that opened eyes and healed hearts.

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The missions committee described how their first step was to thoroughly vet the ministries they invited. But once they sensed God’s confirmation, they did far more than host—they chose to serve. They fed, transported, prayed over, and supported each ministry with unusual intentionality. Their posture was simple: a full “yes” on the table for whatever God wanted to do.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Celebration intentionally highlighted local missions to remove the common excuses: “I don’t know where to serve,” or “There’s nothing around here to do.” Instead, the congregation learned about homelessness in their own community, addiction recovery needs, disaster relief efforts, Habitat for Humanity projects, and the reality of human trafficking in the region. Practical steps such as assembling cracker packs, signing up to volunteer, offering transportation support, and joining in prayer gave immediate avenues for obedience.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    God used the event to forge new partnerships. Freedom Collective offered trafficking-awareness training and posters for the church. A veterinary missions group discussed potential care for the pets of homeless friends. More importantly, perspectives began to shift. People began seeing homelessness and addiction not as choices but as trauma-rooted wounds. One member even found healing regarding his own brother’s addiction, finally seeing him with renewed compassion. Throughout the Celebration, God made it clear: the church is not called to fix people but to plant seeds, build relationships, and trust Him to do the transforming.

                    Maybe you’ve struggled to understand someone caught in addiction. Maybe you’ve felt helpless seeing homelessness up close. Or maybe you’ve believed the lie that you have nothing to offer. The truth is this: Jesus calls you to bring your heart, your presence, and your willingness. You don’t need to be the solution—He is. When you show up with compassion, God uses you in ways you could never imagine.

He is already at work—you’re simply invited to join Him.
