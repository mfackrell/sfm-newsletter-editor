              Words can't even describe the beauty of last night. God's hand has so beautifully intertwined so many lives, ministries, paths, hearts, and talents to converge in one parking lot. A community where friends truly become family.<br /><br />
              In one parking lot we had:<br />
              ➡️ 35 friends and 35 volunteers<br />
              ➡️ a dozen+ different congregations<br />
              ➡️ 2 resource partners<br />
              ➡️ 4 ministries present<br />
              ➡️ a family from Kansas<br />
              ➡️ a nurse<br />
              ➡️ 2 barbers<br />
              ➡️ the Mayor<br />
              ➡️ 8 bikes given away<br /><br />
              THIS IS KINGDOM.<br /><br />
              Coming together to serve one another all for Jesus Christ! It does not get any better than that!

              We provided 29 showers!!! The most in one serve location. 2.5 hours of operating and it was amazing. Also visited the giving closet.<br /><br />
              Brian Loftus, Nancy Ackerman, Heather Chavers, Hannah and Chelsey—thank you to you all. This only happens when you say yes. So thank you for an amazing night to show the love of Jesus!!

              But God!<br /><br />
              He started sticking around a little more. The walls started coming down slowly. The heart started softening to Jesus.<br /><br />
              He was baptized. He became hungry for His Word. He was open to Holy Spirit's transformation. He became a servant of Jesus. He became a disciple.<br /><br />
              Jesus did that!<br /><br />
              Last night, he grilled the hot meal for our friends. A simple act with profound goodness of God!

          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">This is the testimony of one of our volunteers and leaders, Nichole Rambaran:</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">"2015. Lost. Broken. A hot mess. 20 years addicted to meth/xanex/weed/needles/WHATEVER I COULD OBTAIN. Complex PTSD, agoraphobia, behavioral personality disorder, anxiety, depression. Serious mental instability. Starving for food, life, love, attention. Raising 2 little girls alone, pregnant with a 3rd. I didn't know how I would buy Christmas this year. This was the year Jesus began to really speak to me. And I was too addicted/broken/LOST to get to Him.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">It would take 2 years from this point before I would begin my journey to full surrender. Even in the darkness. The high. The witchcraft. The sexual addiction. He was speaking to me, wooing me. When I hit the lowest of low, He was waiting. And He got me.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Today... I belong to Him. Only Him. Sober for 4 years. Thriving. My children are thriving. I am loved, living, validated by Christ. I am a new creation.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">When I look at this broken woman, and I am reminded that I was broken as a little girl. And this woman was her. Today, I am a grown woman, and a daughter of God. Not a broken little girl.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">The enemy has lost his grip on me. I am Blood Bought. Redeemed. Restored. Healed. Whole. Forgiven. Loved. Called. Honored.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">My journey through that hell was so that I could grab others by the hand and pull them out of it, and help them to the foot of the Cross. Where they can find freedom.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">After many years of losing to the devil, I realize: the devil got his butt kicked. And my Jesus don't play about me."</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Today, she is a warrior in the streets—rescuing others as she leads them to the cross. Ushering the broken to freedom.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">NEVER feel like God can't use you. The very story of your life could be the very testimony someone needs to hear to pull them from the pit. Never underestimate what God can do in your life and how He can use you afterwards.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">If you are struggling with similar battles that she found freedom from, reach out to her. I promise you will not find a better battle partner.</p>
          <p style="margin:0 0 0 0;">That is what I LOVE about our Salty Farm Fam. There is ZERO judgement, no condemnation—simply others who have walked through messes, brokenness, addictions, and much more, but have found our way to Jesus. We don't have it all together. But we definitely don't walk through it alone. Need a community that becomes family? Join us.</p>

        <p class="small">Hey Salty Farm Fam, I want to take a second to give a shout out to our volunteers—day in, day out they show up, wanting nothing more than to show the love of Jesus Christ our Savior.<br /><br />So last week I received a message from Rebuild Bay County. They knew they were opening the warming center this week, and for the most part everything is covered except showers. So I had met her the week prior and told her what we do as a ministry, and she wanted to know if we would bring the shower trailer.<br /><br />I told her we serve on Monday nights and would not miss our normal serve night, but if 8:30–9:00 wasn’t too late I would try to get some volunteers to come with me. Friday night I put out the message of what was being asked of us, the location, and the time of night it would be. Let me tell you—instantly I had 3 volunteers jump on it, saying we are there to help serve in whatever way we can.<br /><br />So today help me give a big shout out to the 3 volunteers that came to help serve, in what I’m calling the Late Night Shift!!! 8:30–11 p.m.<br /><br />Brian Loftus, Amy Aubin, Jennifer Lee—thank you for how you all pour your hearts out and choose to do it with Salty Farm Ministries. That goes for all of you that pour out every single day, week in week out. We thank you and love you all.<br /><br />Just saying yes to the Lord is amazing. Your life will change if you just say yes to Him. Give Jesus your yes today. Watch what He does when you do.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <ul><li>Pray for our friends on the streets who are walking through deep hurt, addiction, and urgent medical needs—especially Clay, who had a medical emergency. Ask the Lord for healing, protection, and peace, and for a continued softening of hearts toward Jesus.</li><li>Pray also for our teams as we show up week after week—that God would give wisdom, strength, and Holy Spirit-led words, and that every shower, meal, conversation, and hug would point people to the hope and freedom found in Christ.</li></ul>
