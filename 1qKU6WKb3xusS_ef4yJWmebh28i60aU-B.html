Harris Learning Center in Panama City for the 2nd night this week.<br /><br />We even had high school young ladies that gave their YES—it takes all of us and our YES!!! Thank you again. We provided 29 showers!!! The most in one serve location. 2.5 hours of operating and it was amazing. Also visited the giving closet.<br /><br />Brian Loftus, Nancy Ackerman, Heather Chavers, Hannah, and Chelsey—thank you to you all. This only happens when you say yes. So thank you for an amazing night to show the love of Jesus!!</p>

          <div class="highlight-title">Leaving Lies at the Foot of the Cross</div>
          <p class="highlight-text">Last night, Mark brought the word in the streets. He felt the Lord lead him to talk about how the Word is sharper than any two-edged sword.<br /><br />He asked our friends to write down what lie, hurt, or hang up they held onto in 2025 on one side of an index card. On the other half, he asked them what truth they wanted to carry into 2026. They ripped their cards and left what was at the foot of the cross and behind them. Here are some of those things they laid down.<br /><br />Please join us in praying for these lives, these hurts, these lies, these souls that want something different. We pray that God meet them right where they are and surround them with His peace, His guidance into truth, His love, His joy, His grace, and His mercy. Let all the things that we all want to leave behind stay behind…stay at the foot of the cross. Let us all open ourselves up to the refining and the filling that God wants to lead us in. Amen.</p>

          <p>This truck belongs to a man that didn’t want a single ounce of the gospel. He came for food and left.</p>
          <p>But God!</p>
          <p>He started sticking around a little more. The walls started coming down slowly. The heart started softening to Jesus.</p>
          <p>He was baptized. He became hungry for His Word. He was open to Holy Spirit’s transformation. He became a servant of Jesus. He became a disciple.</p>
          <p>Jesus did that!</p>
          <p>Last night, he grilled the hot meal for our friends. A simple act with profound goodness of God!</p><br /><br />

      <div class="card">
        <p class="small">Hey Salty Farm Fam, I want to take a second to give a shout out to our volunteers. Day in and day out, they show up, wanting nothing more than to show the love of Jesus Christ our Savior!!<br /><br />Last week I received a message from Rebuild Bay County. They knew they were opening the warming center this week, and for the most part everything is covered except showers!! I had met her the week prior and told her what we do as a ministry. So she wanted to know if we would bring the shower trailer.<br /><br />I told her we serve on Monday nights and would not miss our normal serve night, but if 8:30–9:00 wouldn’t be too late, I would try to get some volunteers to come with me. So Friday night I put out the message of what was being asked of us, the location, and the time of night it would be.<br /><br />Let me tell you—instantly I had 3 volunteers jump on it, saying, “We are there to help serve in whatever way we can.”<br /><br />So today help me give a big shout out to the 3 volunteers that came to help serve, in what I’m calling the Late Night Shift!!! 8:30–11 p.m.<br /><br />Brian Loftus, Amy Aubin, Jennifer Lee—thank you for how you all pour your hearts out and choose to do it with Salty Farm Ministries. That goes for all of you that pour out every single day, week in and week out. We thank you and love you all.<br /><br />Just saying yes to the Lord is amazing. Your life will change if you just say yes to Him. Give Jesus your yes today. Watch what He does when you do.</p>
