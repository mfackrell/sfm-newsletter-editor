                At Shiloh Baptist Church in Chipley, Florida, God used the Global Impact Celebration to spark something powerful—an awakening to local mission. Through prayer, outreach, and a willingness to say yes, the church saw hearts open, misconceptions shatter, and new laborers rise up to serve the broken, hungry, addicted, and hurting right in their own community.

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Before committing to partner with Salty Farm Ministries, the pastor of Shiloh Baptist stepped out in faith and personally joined in street outreach, wanting to see the ministry firsthand. God confirmed the partnership quickly, and from that moment, the church’s missions committee—Michelle, Misty, and Jennifer—began seeking the Lord about how to stir their congregation toward obedience.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    They realized many believers felt they “couldn’t go overseas,” so missions felt out of reach. Instead of accepting that limitation, the committee shifted the focus: what if missions didn’t require a passport? What if the mission field was the streets, neighborhoods, and shelters within minutes of their own homes? That single shift changed everything.
                </p>

                <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    During the Global Impact Celebration, Shiloh created space for real relationships. Local partners—including Salty Farm, Habitat for Humanity, Freedom Collective, a disaster relief team, and a veterinary mission—were invited to share their hearts. The response was immediate: people packed crackers for homeless neighbors, signed up for orientations, and took their first steps toward serving. God opened doors for new partnerships, like human-trafficking awareness posters through Freedom Collective and a veterinary team exploring street-pet care for the unsheltered. Even deeper, old assumptions crumbled as attendees realized homelessness isn’t a choice—it's often the tragic result of trauma, addiction, or generational pain. Shiloh was reminded that their responsibility wasn’t to fix people but to love them like Jesus and plant seeds only He can grow.

                    Maybe you’ve felt unqualified or unsure where to start. Maybe brokenness feels too heavy or too messy. But God isn’t asking you to fix what only He can heal. He’s asking you to show up with compassion, humility, and willingness. Like Shiloh, you can make your “yes” available to Him. And when you do, He will lead you to the people who need His love most—right where you live.

                    Pray for God to open your eyes to the needs around you. Repent of any assumptions you’ve held about people living in addiction or homelessness. Ask Jesus to fill you with His compassion and courage, and then take one simple step toward serving your community. You don’t need to travel far—your mission field may be just one street away.
